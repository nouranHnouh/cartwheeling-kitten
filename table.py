# We now would like to summarize this data and make it more visually appealing
# We want to go through count_list and print a table that shows the number and its 
# corresponding count.

# The output should look like this neatly formatted table:
"""
number | occurrence
     0 | 1
     1 | 2
     2 | 3
     3 | 2
     4 | 2
     5 | 1
     6 | 1
     7 | 2
     8 | 3
     9 | 1
    10 | 2
"""
# Here is our code we have written so far:

import random

# Create random list of integers using while loop --------------------
random_list = []
list_length = 20

while len(random_list) < list_length:
    random_list.append(random.randint(0,10))

# Aggregate the data -------------------------------------------------
count_list = [0] * 11
index = 0

while index < len(random_list):
    number = random_list[index]
    count_list[number] = count_list[number] + 1
    index = index + 1
    
# Write code here to summarize count_list and print a neatly formatted table that looks
# like this:

"""
number | occurrence
     0 | 1
     1 | 2
     2 | 3
     3 | 2

     6 | 1

     8 | 3
     9 | 1
    10 | 2

# Hint: To print 10 blank spaces in a row, we can multiply a string by a number "n"
# to print this string n number of times:
index=0
print "number|occurance"
num_len=len("number")

while index<len(count_list):
    num_spaces=num_len-len(str(index))
    
    #print " "*num_spaces+str(index)+'|'+(count_list[index])*"*"
    print " "*num_spaces+str(index)+'|'+str(count_list[index])
    index+=1

# BONUS!
# From your summarize code you just wrote, can you make the table even more visual by 
# replacing the count with a string of asterisks that represent the count of a number?
# The table should look like
